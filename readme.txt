Interactive Grid Application

This project is an interactive grid application built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to create a grid of a specified size, add walls, set a start point, set a goal point, and solve a maze using different search techniques.
Features

- Create a grid of a specified size.
- Add walls to the grid.
- Set a start point on the grid.
- Set one or multiple goal points on the grid.
- Solve the maze using Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), or A Search.
- Clear the grid or specific cells.
- Print the current state of the grid.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Tkinter
- customtkinter

## How to Run
